You customize ZTheme by adding/removing/changing the images in PluginData.

I'd recommend making your own theme however (especially if you use CKAN) since updates can override your changes.
You can make your own theme by copying the ZTheme folder and changing the config file or by following the [HUDReplacer guide](https://github.com/UltraJohn/HUDReplacer?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-create-texture-packs).
