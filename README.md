### How Do I Get The Navball?
- It's NavBallTextureChanger Updated but with Principia's navball.
  Just replace one of the builtin textures with Principia's navball (`ksp_plugin_adapter\assets\navball_compass.png`).

  Alternatively, you could take `navball_compass.png`, resize it to 512x256, rename it to `navball.png`, and put it in any of the ZTheme folders (except for the parent folder). 
  
## Known Issues
 - Some textures are missing icons [#1](https://github.com/zapSNH/ZTheme/issues/1 "#1")
